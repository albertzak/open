a.k.a. **NEW COMMIT EVERY MINUTE**

**STATUS: Highly experimental.** Don't even try. just follow along for now if you want.

so i'm trying to incubate a personal dynamic... nah

is it really that far fetched to want to look inside a variable?

or tell some piece of code to run on that machine over there?



i need to get this thing working well enough to give a fun presentation in 1 week and 1 day.

### TODO

- [ ] share huge apple notes
- [ ] slides (+ text?) of presentations
- [ ] upload codebases as-is (except check gitignore before)
