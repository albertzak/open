_that's basically it. how hard could it be?_




### TODO

- [ ] get this thing working well enough to give a fun presentation in 1 week and 1 day.
- [ ] **CURRENT** share huge apple notes
- [ ] slides (+ text?) of presentations
- [ ] upload codebases as-is (except check gitignore before)



## Random Notes

From 2020-09 until 2024-08 I got paid to daydream (ðŸš®). This is all I have to show for it.

I collected random interesting internet finds in Apple Notes. Order is somewhat chronological, newest at the top. Sadly only very few entries are timestamped or properly sourced.




Multics 1965
"Multiplexed information and computing service"
(ARPA, MIT, Bell labs, GE, precursor project MAC '62 / Licklider "internet" "On-Line Man Computer Communication")


- PL/1, 1MB RAM, NSA >1998
- expensive process creation: 3 procs per user, later 1 proc.
- W^X: actually from a cost mem optimization, keep only one copy in ram, should not modify itself when - - - multiple users access same program

- 70s: Algol, Cobol, Fortran
- Mid-70s: Maclisp Macsyma, APL interpreter
- 80s: C compiler (note: but how is that memory safe then?), pointer maagic, null pointer arithmetic etc,
- 1984 dynamic reconfiguration: CPU, mem, drives, peripherals (Schell 1084)

"Bigger, slower, less reliable than planned" - 60-70 sites, last site closed in 1998

- Myths:
- Not first timesharing
- not first virtual memory
- Thompson's unix "Unics" re-write was the smallest possible timesharing on pdp-7 assembly
- Super secure? Per-user
- Ritchie/Thompson: "Overengineered"

- van horn: supervisor, pdp-1 1969

POLA / least privilege

- 1975 GNOSIS/KeyKOS "cloud computing" (before dial up)
- resume processes within 30s / demo pull plug
- 20kloc
- <100kb kernel ram usage / microkernel, never allocates mem (only mutates processes' memory, unbuffered messagepassing)
- capabilities (naming+locating+accesrights)
- slm/persistent virtual mem/orthogonal persistence
- no serialized on disk/deserialized in mem
- persistent objects: each file/process/supervisor is an object
- home location on disk, optional transparently in ram
- checkpointing, CoW, "opportunistic scheduling"
- network+keyboard journaled (nicht ganz transparente persistency)


- "directory" assocs name with keys
- service keys for debugging, closely held
- "sensory key" solves problem of getting access to a r/w key via a read only key by downgrading all keys fetched via the sensory key to sensory keys.
- discreetness compartments: an actor (domain) with no keys to outside of the domain, avoids exfiltration


- domains=cpu/segments=mem/meters=powersupply


myths: inability to enforce/cannot solve confinement

"just a bit string"

seL4 / 10k lines microkernel, formally verified capability system

lispm

- Hardware Type Checking. Special type bits let the type be checked
  efficiently at run-time.
- Hardware Garbage Collection.
- Fast Function Calls.
- Efficient Representation of Lists.
- System Software and Integrated Programming Environments.


STEPS

literate programming (knuth 1984)

eav / relational

virualizations, bidirectional mapping, "why not drawing?"

Unison

"haskell+erlang"
