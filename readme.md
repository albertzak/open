a.k.a. **NEW COMMIT EVERY MINUTE**

**STATUS: Highly experimental.** Don't even try.

### TODO

- [ ] get this thing working well enough to give a fun presentation in 1 week and 1 day.
- [ ] **CURRENT** share huge apple notes
- [ ] slides (+ text?) of presentations
- [ ] upload codebases as-is (except check gitignore before)
