### TODO

- [ ] get this thing working well enough to give a fun presentation in 1 week and 1 day.
- [ ] **CURRENT** share huge apple notes
- [ ] slides (+ text?) of presentations
- [ ] upload codebases as-is (except check gitignore before)



## Random Notes

From 2020-09 until 2024-08 I got paid to daydream (ðŸš®). This is all I have to show for it.

I collected random interesting internet finds in Apple Notes. Order is somewhat chronological, newest at the top. Sadly only very few entries are timestamped.
